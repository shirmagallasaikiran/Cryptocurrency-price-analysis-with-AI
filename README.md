## 🔍 Project Overview

Cryptocurrency markets are volatile and dynamic, challenging analysts and traders to extract meaningful trends.  
This repository provides a complete pipeline to **analyze historical price data**, **build predictive models**, and **visualize AI-based insights** that assist in understanding crypto price behavior.

The core goal is to leverage machine learning — particularly models suited for time-series forecasting — to understand patterns and make short-term price predictions.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📈 **Historical Price Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
  Support for loading and transforming price series from CSV or APIs.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning & AI Models**  
  Train and evaluate models such as:
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
  - GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
  - Traditional regressors (optional)
  
  (Customize this list based on your actual implementation.)

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visuals**  
  Charts and analytics showing price trends, volume, volatility, and rolling statistics.

- 📉 **Forecasting & Prediction Outputs**  
  Compare predicted vs. actual price performance with performance metrics like MAE & RMSE.

- 📁 **Modular Design**  
  Clear folder structure for data, notebooks, and model artifacts.
